In this post I present my dissertation, or the Capstone project completed as the final work of the MSc Applied 
Social Data Science program. In this project, I used data from various Reddit communities that I scraped myself using
Pushshift API in Python, as well as __[AskReddit data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/ten-million-reddit-answers)__.
I preprocess the data and conduct some preliminary analysis in R, mainly using the quanteda package for quantitative
text analysis. Finally, I estimate predictive models using scikit-learn and TensorFlow, achieving the best performance
with the neural network. 

Please note that the corresponding code files are uploaded __[in this repository](https://github.com/mariaadshead/dissertation_code/tree/main)__.
