Hello!

I am currently looking for job opportunities in data & analytics, and my most recent professional experience was working as a Business Analyst Intern at Amazon. My day-to-day tasks involved working with SQL and Python, including pandas, selenium and other packages, as well as Excel and BI tools. I hold a masters degree in Applied Social Data Science from the LSE, and also a bachelor's degree in economics.

This site is meant to showcase my programming skills in Python, R, and SQL in the form of projects that I completed either for my university courses or out of personal interest. Feel free to reach out to me via e-mail or LinkedIn.
