Hello!

I currently work as a Business Analyst Intern at Amazon. My day-to-day tasks involve working with SQL and Python, including pandas, selenium and other packages, as well as Excel and BI tools. I hold a masters degree in Applied Social Data Science from the LSE, and also a bachelor's degree in economics.

Currently I am interested in taking my career into the direction of data science and machine learning. The domains that I am particularly interested in are music, social media and technology.

This site is meant to showcase my programming skills in Python, R, and SQL in the form of projects that I completed either for my university courses or out of personal interest. Feel free to reach out to me via e-mail or LinkedIn.
