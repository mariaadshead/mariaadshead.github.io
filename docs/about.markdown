Hello!

I am a postgraduate data science student at LSE, enrolled in the MSc Applied Social Data Science programme. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance from the International College of Economics in Finance, which was a joint programme between the University of London and the Higher School of Economics. 

Currently I am interested in taking my career into the direction of data analytics, data science and machine learning. The domains that I am particularly interested in are music, social media and technology.

This site is meant to showcase my programming skills in Python, R, and SQL in the form of projects that I completed either for my university courses or out of personal interest. Feel free to reach out to me via e-mail or LinkedIn.
